- question: What is the primary advantage of the Baltimore classification system?
  answer: The primary advantage of the Baltimore classification system is that it
    allows viruses that behave similarly to be studied as distinct groups by classifying
    them based on their manner of mRNA synthesis.
- question: How many Baltimore groups are there?
  answer: There are seven Baltimore groups numbered with Roman numerals.
- question: What is the primary characteristic that separates dsDNA viruses from
    ssDNA viruses?
  answer: The primary characteristic that separates dsDNA viruses from ssDNA viruses
    is the strandedness of the genome, where dsDNA viruses have a double-stranded
    genome while ssDNA viruses have a single-stranded genome.
- question: What are the three mechanisms by which dsDNA viruses replicate their
    genome?
  answer: The three mechanisms by which dsDNA viruses replicate their genome are bidirectional
    replication, rolling circle replication, and strand displacement.
- question: How do dsDNA viruses that replicate in the nucleus differ from those
    that replicate in the cytoplasm?
  answer: dsDNA viruses that replicate in the nucleus are relatively dependent on
    host cell machinery for transcription and replication, while those that replicate
    in the cytoplasm have evolved or acquired their own means of executing transcription
    and replication.
- question: What is the primary difference between dsDNA viruses and dsRNA viruses?
  answer: The primary difference between dsDNA viruses and dsRNA viruses is the composition
    of their genomes, with dsDNA viruses having a deoxyribonucleic acid genome and
    dsRNA viruses having a ribonucleic acid genome.
- question: How do ssDNA viruses replicate their genome?
  answer: ssDNA viruses replicate their genome by first converting the single-stranded
    genome into a double-stranded form upon entering a host cell, followed by mRNA
    synthesis from the double-stranded form.
- question: What is the primary difference between positive sense and negative
    sense ssRNA viruses?
  answer: The primary difference between positive sense and negative sense ssRNA viruses
    is the orientation of their single-stranded RNA genome, with positive sense viruses
    having a genome that can be directly translated by host machinery and negative
    sense viruses requiring complementary strand synthesis.
- question: How do parvoviruses replicate their linear ssDNA genome?
  answer: Parvoviruses replicate their linear ssDNA genome via rolling hairpin replication
    (RHR), where hairpin loops at each end of the genome unfold and refold during
    replication to change the direction of DNA synthesis.
- question: What is the primary characteristic that separates ssDNA viruses from
    dsDNA viruses?
  answer: The primary characteristic that separates ssDNA viruses from dsDNA viruses
    is the composition of their genomes, with ssDNA viruses having a single-stranded
    genome and dsDNA viruses having a double-stranded genome.
- question: What is the primary difference between dsRNA viruses and +ssRNA viruses?
  answer: The primary difference between dsRNA viruses and +ssRNA viruses is the sense
    of their RNA genome, with dsRNA viruses having a double-stranded RNA genome and
    +ssRNA viruses having a positive sense single-stranded RNA genome.
- question: How do dsRNA viruses replicate their genome?
  answer: dsRNA viruses replicate their genome by transcribing mRNA from the negative
    strand of the double-stranded RNA genome using the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
- question: What is the primary difference between +ssRNA viruses and -ssRNA
    viruses?
  answer: The primary difference between +ssRNA viruses and -ssRNA viruses is the
    orientation of their single-stranded RNA genome, with +ssRNA viruses having a
    genome that can be directly translated and -ssRNA viruses having a genome that
    needs to be complemented before translation.
- question: How do +ssRNA viruses replicate their genome?
  answer: +ssRNA viruses replicate their genome by directly using their positive-sense
    RNA genome as a template for translation and replication.
- question: What is the primary difference between dsRNA viruses and +ssRNA viruses?
  answer: The primary difference between dsRNA viruses and +ssRNA viruses is the composition
    of their genomes, with dsRNA viruses having a double-stranded RNA genome and +ssRNA
    viruses having a positive sense single-stranded RNA genome.
- question: How do +ssRNA viruses replicate their genome?
  answer: +ssRNA viruses replicate their genome by using their positive-sense RNA
    genome directly as a template for both translation and replication.
- question: What is the primary difference between +ssRNA viruses and -ssRNA
    viruses?
  answer: The primary difference between +ssRNA viruses and -ssRNA viruses is the
    orientation of their single-stranded RNA genome, with +ssRNA viruses having a
    genome that can be directly translated and -ssRNA viruses having a genome that
    needs complementary strand synthesis before translation.
- question: How do -ssRNA viruses replicate their genome?
  answer: -ssRNA viruses replicate their genome by first using their negative-sense
    RNA genome as a template to synthesize a complementary positive-sense RNA strand
    for translation and replication.
- question: What is the primary difference between +ssRNA viruses and -ssRNA
    viruses?
  answer: The primary difference between +ssRNA viruses and -ssRNA viruses is the
    orientation of their single-stranded RNA genome, with +ssRNA viruses having a
    genome that can be directly translated and -ssRNA viruses needing complementary
    strand synthesis before translation.
- question: How do -ssRNA viruses replicate their genome?
  answer: -ssRNA viruses replicate their genome by using their negative-sense RNA
    genome as a template to synthesize a complementary positive-sense RNA strand,
    which is then used for translation and replication processes.
